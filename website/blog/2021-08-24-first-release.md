I work on this framework a lot, and it is very useful for me, but I want to share it, so It is open source! In the future, I will continue to work to make it better and easier to use, as well as fully covered by tests.

If you encounter any problems feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/siposdani87/sui-js/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). If you feel the library is missing a feature, please raise a [ticket](https://github.com/siposdani87/sui-js/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). Pull request are also welcome.
